# Neural Network Development Application

## Overview
The Neural Network Development Application is a streamlined tool designed for training, evaluating, testing, and deploying predictive neural networks with ease. Launched in January 2024, this application features a user-friendly interface ideal for educational purposes and the early stages of neural network development.

## Key Features
- **Support for CNN and CNN-Feedforward Hybrid Architectures**: Build complex models suited for a variety of tasks.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Utilizes the TensorFlow library to leverage GPU acceleration for efficient model training.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplifies the process of neural network configuration and management, making it accessible to both novices and experienced users.
- **Session Logging**: Automatically logs details of training and testing sessions for review and analysis.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Offers tools to evaluate the effectiveness of training and testing sessions.
- **Support for Multiple Layers**: Currently supports up to 3 layers and plans to expand to recursive architectures.
